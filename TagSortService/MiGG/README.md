**Why MiGG?**

MiGG is a minified, lightweight reincarnation of [KiGG](http://kigg.codeplex.com/).

Back then, in 2009, KiGG was the only content aggregator ever written in C#.

A lot has changed in web since then:
* now we have hassle-free client-side data rendering 
* now we have microservices
* often we don't need slow ORMs, as we have nosql now
* we can unload heavy background jobs from web server to hadoop/spark/storm... 
* machine-learning tools have become much more approachable than before

With all that above why not re-animate KiGG?

The KiGG is dead, long live the MiGG !
