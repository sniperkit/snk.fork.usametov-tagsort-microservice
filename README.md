## Tag Sort Utility

This is small utility to create/edit tag bundles, similar to tag bundles functionality provided by Delicious web site. The need for this rise with the wish to organize content coming from different sources.
This is because different people use different tags for the same things. This is why we want to bundle similar/related tags together to facilitate bookmarks management. 
This has also number of other use cases such as: 
* building training data set for text mining (machine learning) projects
* better UI functionality for search engines (like facets, etc.)

This project is bundled with [Bookmarks-ETL](https://github.com/usametov/Bookmarks-ETL), which is another project of mine.

Some of the solutions dependencies:
* NancyFX (from Nuget)
* Automapper (from Nuget)
* MongoDB (from Nuget)
* xUnit (from Nuget)
* [Bookmarks.Common](https://github.com/usametov/Bookmarks-ETL/tree/master/Common)
